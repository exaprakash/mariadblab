or copy the provided Software to an extent that is not in accordance with 
its designated use, Sec. 69d German Copyright Act. A decompilation is only

Copyright Act.

2.4 Title to the Software, and copyrights and all other property rights

  (ii) in case of injuries to life, body and health, 
  (iii) pursuant to the terms of German Product Liability Act 
  (ProdHaftG), or 
  (iv) under a guarantee granted by Exasol.

3.2 Notwithstanding the above Exasol disclaims all warranties express, 
statutory or implied, including without limitation the implied warranties 
or conditions of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose or 
the statutory warranties in case of defects as to quality (Sachmangel) or

intended result, be compatible or work with any software, systems, or 
other services, or be secure, accurate, complete, free of harmful code

including any necessary or required licenses. Licensee shall not export

Licensee ("Pre-Existing Contract"), the terms and conditions of this 
Terms & Conditions shall prevail to the extent of such conflict.

5.5 In the event that one or more provisions of the Terms & Conditions 
should be or become invalid or unenforceable, the validity of the 
remaining provisions shall not be affected thereby. The invalid or 
unenforceable provision shall be deemed to be replaced with such legally 
permissible provision which comes as close as possible to the economic 
purpose of the invalid or unenforceable provision.
